# Functional Programming

It is an approach to programming where computations are built up from combining functions that don't modify their arguments that don't refer to or change the program's state, and that provide their results as return values.

One strong appeal of this kind of programming is that;
It is much easier to develop functions in isolation and to debug functional programs. This is helped by the fact that functional programs don't have state changes, so it is possible to reason about their functions mathematically.

Three important concepts that are strongly associated with functional programming are:
 - mapping;
 - filtering;
 - reducing


## FP Languages

Functional programming languages offer unique paradigms for solving problems and are valuable for developers to learn. In 2023, here are some functional programming languages that are worth considering:

### Haskell:

Haskell is a purely functional, statically typed language known for its strong type system and purity guarantees. It's an excellent choice for learning functional programming concepts and has a vibrant community.

### Scala:

Scala combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. It's compatible with Java, making it a popular choice for building scalable and high-performance systems.

### Elixir:

Elixir is designed for building fault-tolerant, distributed, and concurrent applications. It runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM) and is known for its robustness in building systems with high availability.

### Clojure:

Clojure is a Lisp dialect that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It emphasizes immutability, simplicity, and functional programming. It's used in web development, data analysis, and more.

### F# (F Sharp):

F# is a functional-first language developed by Microsoft. It's part of the .NET ecosystem and is used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning.

### Elm:

Elm is a functional language for front-end web development. It's known for its strong type system, immutability, and reliable error messages, making it a solid choice for building web applications.

### PureScript:

PureScript is a strongly typed, Haskell-inspired language that compiles JavaScript. It's designed for building front-end applications with the benefits of functional programming.

### Racket:

Racket is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm language that includes functional programming. It's particularly well-suited for teaching programming concepts and building domain-specific languages.

### Erlang:

Erlang is known for its concurrency and fault-tolerance features. It's used extensively in telecommunications and distributed systems.

### Scheme:

Scheme is a minimalist dialect of Lisp known for its simplicity and elegance. It's often used for teaching programming fundamentals and understanding language design.
