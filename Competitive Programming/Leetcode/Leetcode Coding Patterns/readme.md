### [Sliding Window]()

*Usage* : This algorithmic technique is used when we need to handle the input data in specific window size.


**Sample Problems**:
- [Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters]()
- [Fruits into Baskets]()
- [Permutation in a String]()


###[Two Pointers]()

*Usage* : In this technique, we use two pointers to iterate the input data. Generally, both pointers move in the opposite direction at a constant interval.


**Sample Problems**:

- [Squaring a Sorted Array]()
- [Dutch National Flag Problem]()
- [Minimum Window Sort]()


### [3. Fast & Slow Pointers]()
*Usage:* Also known as Hare & Tortoise algorithm. In this technique, we use two pointers that traverse the input data at a different speed.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Middle of the LinkedList]()
- [Happy Number]()
- [Cycle in a Circular Array]()


### [Merge Intervals]()

*Usage:* This technique is used to deal with overlapping intervals. Given two intervals (‘a’ and ‘b’), there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other:


**Sample Problems:**

- [Intervals Intersection]()
- [Conflicting Appointments]()
- [Minimum Meeting Rooms]()



### [Cyclic Sort]()

*Usage:* Use this technique to solve array problems where the input data lies within a fixed range.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Find all Missing Numbers]()
- [Find all Duplicate Numbers]()
- [Find the First K Missing Positive Numbers]()



### [In-place Reversal of a LinkedList]()

*Usage:* This technique describes an efficient way to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a LinkedList. Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing node objects and without using extra memory.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Reverse every K-element Sub-list]()
- [Rotate a LinkedList]()



### [Tree Breadth-First Search]()

*Usage:* As the name suggests, this technique is used to solve problems involving traversing trees in a breadth-first search manner.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal]()
- [Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree]()
- [Connect Level Order Siblings]()



### [Tree Depth First Search]()
*Usage:* As the name suggests, this technique is used to solve problems involving traversing trees in depth-first search manner.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Path With Given Sequence]()
- [Count Paths for a Sum]()


### [Two Heaps]()
*Usage:* In many problems, where we are given a set of elements such that we can divide them into two parts. We are interested in knowing the smallest element in one part and the biggest element in the other part. As the name suggests, this technique uses a Min-Heap to find the smallest element and a Max-Heap to find the biggest element.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Find the Median of a Number Stream]()
- [Next Interval]()



### [Subsets]()

*Usage:* Use this technique when the problem asks to deal with permutations or combinations of a set of elements.


**Sample Problems:**

- [String Permutations by changing case]()
- [Unique Generalized Abbreviations]()


### [Modified Binary Search]()

*Usage:* Use this technique to search a sorted set of elements efficiently.

**Sample Problems:**

- [Ceiling of a Number]()
- [Bitonic Array Maximum]()



### [Bitwise XOR]()

*Usage:* This technique uses the XOR operator to manipulate bits to solve problems.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Two Single Numbers]()
- [Flip and Invert an Image]()


### [Top ‘K’ Elements]()

*Usage:* This technique is used to find top/smallest/frequently occurring ‘K’ elements in a set.


**Sample Problems:**

- [‘K’ Closest Points to the Origin]()
- [Maximum Distinct Elements]()



### [K-way Merge]()

*Usage:* This technique helps us solve problems that involve a list of sorted arrays.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Kth Smallest Number in M Sorted Lists]()
- [Kth Smallest Number in a Sorted Matrix]()


### [0/1 Knapsack]()

*Usage:* This technique is used to solve optimization problems. Use this technique to select elements that give maximum profit from a given set with a limitation on capacity and that each element can only be picked once.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Equal Subset Sum Partition]()
- [Minimum Subset Sum Difference]()



### [Unbounded Knapsack]()

*Usage:* Use this technique to select elements that give maximum profit from a given set with a limitation on capacity and that each element can be picked multiple times.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Rod Cutting]()
- [Coin Change]()



### [Fibonacci Numbers]()

*Usage:* Use this technique to solve problems that follow the Fibonacci numbers sequence, i.e., every subsequent number is calculated from the last few numbers.

**Sample Problems:**

- [Staircase]()
- [House Thief]()



### [Palindromic Subsequence]()

*Usage:* This technique is used to solve optimization problems related to palindromic sequences or strings.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Longest Palindromic Subsequence]()
- [Minimum Deletions in a String to make it a Palindrome]()



### [Longest Common Substring]()

*Usage:* Use this technique to find the optimal part of a string/sequence or set of strings/sequences.


**Sample Problems:**
- [Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence]()
- [Edit Distance]()




### [Topological Sort]()

*Usage:* Use this technique to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Tasks Scheduling]()
- [Alien Dictionary]()


### [Trie Traversal]()

*Usage:* Use this technique that involves creating or traversing of Trie data structure.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Longest Word in Dictionary]()
- [Palindrome Pairs]()


### [Number of Island]()

*Usage:* Use this technique to traverse a two-dimensional array and find a set of connected elements.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Number of Distinct Islands]()
- [Maximum Area of Island]()


### [Trial & Error]()

*Usage:* Use this technique to traverse an array to find a required optimal element. The traversal process runs in a trial & error manner.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Find Kth Smallest Pair Distance]()
- [Minimize Max Distance to Gas Station]()



### [Union Find]()

*Usage:* Use this technique to solve problems that require maintaining a given set of elements partitioned into multiple non-overlapping subsets.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Number of Provinces]()
- [Bipartite Graph]()


### [Unique Paths]()

*Usage:* Use this technique to find different/optimal ways to traverse a multi-dimensional array.


**Sample Problems:**

- [Find Unique Paths]()
- [Dungeon Game]()
