## Intermediate Level Projects

- **Microservices Architecture**: Build a microservices-based application using containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes). Implement service discovery, load balancing, and resilience patterns like circuit breakers and retries.
- **Infrastructure Automation with Ansible**: Create Ansible playbooks to automate the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure components such as servers, databases, and load balancers.
- **Monitoring and Logging Setup**: Set up a monitoring and logging stack using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack. Monitor system metrics, application performance, and logs in a centralized dashboard.
