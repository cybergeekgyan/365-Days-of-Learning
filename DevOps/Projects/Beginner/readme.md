## Beginner Level Projects 

- **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**: Create a basic CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins or GitLab CI. Start with a simple application (e.g., a basic web application) and automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform**: Set up infrastructure components such as virtual machines, networks, and storage on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) using Terraform. Start with simple configurations and gradually add complexity.
- **Containerization with Docker**: Dockerize a simple web application or service and deploy it to a container orchestration platform like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.
