## Advanced Level Projects

- **Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for machine learning models. Automate model training, testing, and deployment using tools like Kubeflow or MLflow.

- **Multi-Cloud Deployment**: Design and implement a deployment strategy that spans multiple cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Use tools like Terraform and Kubernetes to achieve portability and redundancy across clouds.

- **Chaos Engineering**: Implement chaos engineering principles to test the resilience of your infrastructure and applications. Introduce controlled failures (e.g., network partitions, server failures) and observe how your system responds.
