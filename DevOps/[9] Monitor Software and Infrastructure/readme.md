# Monitoring Software and Infrastructure 

DevOps monitoring entails overseeing the entire development process from planning, development, integration and testing, deployment, and operations. It involves a complete and real-time view of the status of applications, services, and infrastructure in the production environment. Features such as real-time streaming, historical replay, and visualizations are critical components of application and service monitoring.

## Infrastructure Monitoring 

Monitoring refers to the practice of making the performance and status of infrastructure visible. This section contains common tools used for monitoring.

This is a very vendor-heavy space - use caution when studying materials exclusively from a given product or project, as there are many conflicting opinions and strategies in use. There is no single solution for the most substantially complex internet-facing applications, so understanding the pros and cons of these tools will be useful in helping you plan how to monitor a system for a given goal.

## Application Monitoring
Application monitoring refers to the practice of making the status and performance of a given application visible. This may include details such as stacktraces, error logs, and the line of code implicated in a given failure. When combined with Infrastructure monitoring, this can provide a complete picture of what is happening in your system, and why.
