# SOLID Design Principles

- Introduced by Robert C. Martin and Michael Feathers 
- SOLID is an acronym for five object-oriented design principles that promote maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. 

üïπÔ∏è**Single Responsibility Principle:**
 A class should have only one responsibility and one reason to change. This principle encourages developers to create smaller, and more manageable classes that are easier to understand and modify..

 üïπÔ∏è **Open/Closed Principle:**
  Software entities(classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle allows developers to add new functionality without modifying the existing code, leading to more stable and maintainable software.

 üïπÔ∏è **Liskov Substitution Principle:**
  Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that inheritance is used correctly and that subclasses can be used interchangeably with their base classes.

 üïπÔ∏è **Interface Segregation Principle:**
  Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use. This principle encourages developers to create smaller, more focused interfaces that are tailored to the needs of the client.

 üïπÔ∏è **Dependency Inversion Principle:**
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages developers to design software in a way that reduces dependencies and makes it easier to change and maintain.

## Design Patterns

**1. Creational**
  - Builder
  - Factories
    - Abstract Factory
    - Factory Method
  - Prototype
  - Singleton

**2. Structural**
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy

**3. Behavioral**
   - Chain Of Responsibility
   - Command
   - Interpreter
   - Iterator
   - Mediator
   - Memento
   - Null Object
   - Observer
   - State
   - Strategy
   - Template Method
   - Visitor
